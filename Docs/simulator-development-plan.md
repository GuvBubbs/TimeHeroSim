## Development Principles

### Priority Order
1. **Core simulation accuracy** - Must predict progression correctly
2. **Data integrity** - Never modify game values
3. **Performance** - Must handle 28-day simulations smoothly
4. **Usability** - Clear interface and useful outputs
5. **Advanced features** - Nice-to-have analysis tools

### Testing Strategy
- Test each phase before moving to next
- Use console logging before UI
- Validate against expected progression times
- Run edge cases early and often

### Incremental Validation
After each phase, validate:
- Tutorial completes in 2 hours
- First helper discovered around day 4-5
- Energy generation matches targets
- Phase transitions occur correctly

### Time Estimates
- **Minimum viable simulator**: Phase 0-6 (30 days)
- **Full-featured simulator**: All phases (45-50 days)
- **Solo developer**: Add 50% to estimates
- **First-time Vue developer**: Add 100% to estimates

### Critical Path
These must be completed in order:
1. Data import system (Phase 0)
2. Core game state (Phase 1)
3. Simulation engine (Phase 2)
4. Basic UI (Phase 6)

Everything else can be reordered based on needs.

### Risk Mitigation
- **Biggest risk**: Simulation accuracy
  - Mitigation: Test early, test often
- **Second risk**: Performance with large logs
  - Mitigation: Implement pagination early
- **Third risk**: Data corruption
  - Mitigation: Immutable structures from start

## Quick Start Path

If you need results fast, build in this order:
1. Phase 0 + 1: Foundation and state (Days 1-5)
2. Phase 2: Core simulation (Days 6-10)
3. Phase 6: Basic UI (Days 26-30)
4. Test and validate
5. Add other features as needed

This gives you a working simulator in ~15 days that can answer basic balance questions.
