# Time Hero Simulator - Key Changes Summary

## Quick Reference: Old vs New Game Design

### Fundamental Change: Time System
- **OLD**: Game days (Day 1, Day 2, etc.) with accelerated time

  - Offline progression continues in real-time

### Phase Progression
- **OLD**: Time-based (Tutorial Day 1, Early Days 2-3, etc.)
- **NEW**: Achievement-based via Land Deeds
  - Tutorial: 3‚Üí8 plots
  - Early: 8‚Üí20 plots  
  - Mid: 20‚Üí40 plots (Homestead Deed)
  - Late: 40‚Üí65 plots (Manor Grounds Deed)
  - Endgame: 65‚Üí90 plots (Great Estate Deed)

### Screen Navigation
- **OLD**: Single screen with all systems

  - Nets improve active catch rate
  - Auto-Catchers for passive collection

### Vendor System (Town)
- **OLD**: Single upgrade shop
- **NEW**: 6 specialized vendors
  - **Blacksmith**: Tools, weapons, forge upgrades
  - **Agronomist**: Farm infrastructure
  - **Land Steward**: Land deeds
  - **Carpenter**: Tower, gnome housing
  - **Skills Trainer**: Hero abilities
  - **Material Trader**: Resource exchange

### Tool Progression
- **OLD**: Single tool version
- **NEW**: Three tiers per tool
  - Base: Enable mechanic
  - Plus (+): 2x efficiency, need boss materials
  - Master: 3-4x efficiency, special abilities, epic names

### Upgrade Prerequisites
- **OLD**: Mostly day-based unlocks
- **NEW**: Complex prerequisite chains
  - Previous upgrade requirements
  - Farm stage requirements (üè° icons)
  - Tool/building requirements
  - Boss material requirements

### Mining System
- **OLD**: Simple energy ‚Üí materials
- **NEW**: Depth-based with exponential drain
  - 10 depth levels (Surface to Abyss)
  - Energy drain doubles each level (2‚Üí4‚Üí8‚Üí16...)
  - Pickaxe efficiency reduces drain
  - Shortcuts to start at cleared depths

### Crafting/Forge
- **OLD**: Instant crafting
- **NEW**: Time-based with heat mechanics
  - Bellows control heat bands
  - Success rates based on heat
  - Batch crafting unlocks
  - Material refinement required

### Crop System
- **OLD**: Unlock by day (Day 1, Day 3, etc.)
- **NEW**: Seed Levels 0-9
  - Tied to Tower reach levels
  - 30 total crops (was ~20)
  - Longer growth times for late crops (up to 50 min)

### Adventure Routes
- **OLD**: 8 routes with simple scaling
- **NEW**: 7 main routes with complex mechanics
  - Enemy composition affects strategy
  - Boss fights with weaknesses
  - Armor drops from bosses
  - First clear bonuses (gnome rescues)

### Resource Caps
- **OLD**: Simple energy/gold caps
- **NEW**: Multiple storage systems
  - Energy: 50‚Üí100,000
  - Water: 20‚Üí10,000
  - Seeds: 50‚Üí2,000
  - Materials: 50‚Üí1,000 per type
  - Gold: No cap

### Player Decisions
- **OLD**: Simple priority system
- **NEW**: Complex decision tree
  - Screen navigation choices
  - Combat loadout selection
  - Helper role assignments
  - Mining depth targets
  - Forge queue management

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Data Structure Philosophy
1. **Immutable Game Values**: Never modify imported CSVs
2. **Simulation Rules**: Separate from game values, can be tweaked
3. **Player Behavior**: Configurable per archetype

### New Metrics to Track
- Screen time distribution (% per screen)
- Combat success rates by loadout
- Helper efficiency by role
- Material bottlenecks by phase
- Offline vs active progression ratio

### Validation Priorities
1. **Phase Timing**: Must match design targets
2. **Helper Discovery**: Day 4-5 first gnome
3. **Resource Balance**: No infinite loops
4. **Combat Viability**: All routes completable
5. **Offline Fairness**: Meaningful but not overpowered

### Key Paradigm Shifts to Model
1. **Day 4-5**: First gnome transforms farming
2. **Day 10-12**: Multiple helpers enable 40+ plots
3. **Day 18-20**: Full automation achieved
4. **Day 25-30**: Optimization and perfection

### Phase 2 (UI)
- Vendor categorization clarity
- Prerequisite visualization
- Multi-currency display
- Farm stage indicators

### Phase 3 (Engine)
- Real-time progression accuracy
- Combat formula correctness
- Helper automation logic
- Offline calculation fairness

### Phase 4 (UI)
- Screen time tracking
- Combat panel functionality
- Helper management interface
- Mining depth visualization

### Phase 5 (Reports)
- Metric calculation accuracy
- Report generation speed
- Export format completeness
- Bottleneck identification

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't use game days** - Everything is real-time minutes
2. **Don't unlock by time** - Use prerequisites and achievements
3. **Don't skip refinement** - Raw materials can't be used directly
4. **Don't ignore housing** - Gnomes need homes to work
5. **Don't simplify combat** - Full weapon triangle matters
6. **Don't flatten progression** - Paradigm shifts are critical
7. **Don't merge screens** - Each has distinct purpose
8. **Don't rush offline** - Cap at 24 hours, balance carefully

## Success Metrics

The simulator succeeds when it can:
1. Predict phase timing within ¬±10%
2. Identify helper discovery as paradigm shift
3. Show screen time distribution accurately
4. Calculate combat outcomes deterministically
5. Model offline progression fairly
6. Generate actionable balance recommendations
7. Export data for further analysis
8. Run 1000 Monte Carlo simulations efficiently
