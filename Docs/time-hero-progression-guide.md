## Core Progression Philosophy

### Early Game (Days 1-3)
Focus on **learning systems** and establishing routines. Players check in every 30-60 minutes, manually managing everything while discovering new mechanics.

### Mid Game (Days 3-7)
The **first paradigm shift** occurs when manual play becomes overwhelming. Discovery of helpers transforms the game from "doing" to "managing."

### Late Game (Week 2)
**Automation takes over** as multiple helpers handle routine tasks. Players focus on optimization and strategic decisions rather than execution.

### Endgame (Weeks 3-4)
**Empire management** becomes the focus. Players orchestrate complex helper networks while pursuing perfect efficiency and optimization challenges.

### Post-Endgame (Months)
**Infinite optimization** provides endless goals. Whether through prestige resets or continued expansion, players always have something to pursue.

## Success Metrics

- **Day 1**: Can sustain basic adventures
- **Day 3**: First helper discovered
- **Week 1**: Farm fully expanded once
- **Week 2**: Automation handles 50%+ of tasks
- **Week 3**: Deep mines accessible
- **Week 4**: Ready for infinite optimization
- **Month+**: Personal goals and perfect efficiency

This progression ensures players are never overwhelmed, always have clear goals, and experience multiple fundamental shifts in how they interact with the game.
