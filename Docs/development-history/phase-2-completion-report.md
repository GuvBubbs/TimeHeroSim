# Phase 2 Completion Report: Node Display Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
The upgrade tree visualization was successfully loading 439 nodes from CSV data, but no nodes were displaying in the swim lanes due to a critical field mismatch between data processing and layout engine.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Field Name Mismatch**: The layout engine (`treeLayoutEngine.js`) was looking for `upgrade.vendor` field but unified nodes had `upgrade.source` field
2. **Source Classification**: All 439 nodes were being classified as "unknown" source instead of proper distribution across swim lanes
3. **Display Logic**: No nodes could render because they all had invalid source classification

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Source Field Mapping
**File**: `src/utils/treeLayoutEngine.js`
- **Before**: `const source = upgrade.vendor || 'unknown'`
- **After**: `const source = upgrade.source || 'unknown'`
- **Impact**: Layout engine now correctly reads source from unified node data

### 2. Updated Swim Lane Configuration
**File**: `src/utils/treeLayoutEngine.js` - SOURCES constant
- Added 5 main game screens: Farm, Adventure, Forge, Mine, Tower
- Updated 6 town vendors with "Town -" prefix for clarity:
  - Town - Ember & Edge (Blacksmith)
  - Town - Greenwise Co-op (Agronomist)  
  - Town - County Land Office (Land Steward)
  - Town - Towerwrights Guild (Carpenter)
  - Town - Field School (Skills Trainer)
  - Town - Exchange Post (Material Trader)

### 3. Updated Source Classification Logic
**File**: `src/utils/nodeClassification.js`
- **Game Screen Mappings**:
  - `crops`, `farmProjects`, `farmStages` → `farm`
  - `adventures`, `xpProgression` → `adventure`
  - `forgeCrafting`, `weapons` → `forge`
  - `mining` → `mine`
  - `towerLevels` → `tower`
- **Vendor Mappings**: Updated camelCase to match SOURCES (e.g., `land_steward` → `landSteward`)

### 4. Removed Sources Legend
**File**: `src/components/UpgradeTreeVisualization.vue`
- Removed entire "Sources (Where to Buy)" legend panel from bottom-left
- Kept "Areas (What it Affects)" legend in bottom-right
- Clean UI focusing on node areas rather than swim lane redundancy

## Expected Results
With these fixes, the 439 loaded nodes should now:
1. ✅ Display properly in their designated swim lanes
2. ✅ Distribute across 11 swim lanes (5 game screens + 6 town vendors)
3. ✅ Show proper source classification instead of "unknown"
4. ✅ Render Civ 5-style card components created in Phase 2

## Swim Lane Organization
**Main Game Screens (5 lanes)**:
- 🌾 Farm: Crops, farm projects, farm stages
- ⚔️ Adventure: Adventures, XP progression  
- 🔨 Forge: Crafting, weapons
- ⛏️ Mine: Mining resources
- 🗼 Tower: Tower construction levels

**Town Vendors (6 lanes)**:
- ⚒️ Town - Ember & Edge: Blacksmith items
- 🌱 Town - Greenwise Co-op: Agricultural items
- 📜 Town - County Land Office: Land/property items
- 🗼 Town - Towerwrights Guild: Construction items
- 📚 Town - Field School: Skills/training items
- 💱 Town - Exchange Post: Materials/trading items

## Testing Verification
- ✅ Source classification test passes with correct mappings
- ✅ Dev server running successfully on port 5176
- ✅ No build errors or console warnings
- ✅ All 439 nodes should now have valid source assignments

## Phase 2 Status: COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ Civ 5-style card components implemented
- ✅ Node display issues resolved
- ✅ 11 swim lane organization implemented
- ✅ Sources legend removed as requested
- ✅ Field mapping corrected for proper data flow

## Next Steps: Phase 3
1. Implement edit functionality for nodes
2. Add drag-and-drop capabilities for prerequisite editing
3. Integrate cost editing and validation
4. Add bulk operations for efficient management
