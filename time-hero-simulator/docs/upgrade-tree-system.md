# üå≥ Upgrade Tree System - Data Visualization Tool

## Current Status & Goals

**PRIMARY GOAL**: Create a clean, Civilization V-style upgrade tree that serves as a **pure data visualization tool** without any gameplay elements. This is designed to display upgrade relationships and data structures, not to function as an interactive gameplay interface.

**CURRENT STATE**: 
- ‚úÖ Visual layout and node rendering working
- ‚úÖ Data loading and processing complete
- ‚úÖ Clean data-only tooltips (no gameplay status)
- ‚úÖ All gameplay logic removed from visualization
- ‚ùå **KNOWN ISSUE**: Zoom controls not working (viewTransform reactivity issue between composable and template)

## Overview

The Upgrade Tree is a **Civilization V-style** data visualization system that displays all game upgrades in a hierarchical, left-to-right progression format. It helps developers and users understand the complete upgrade dependency chain and data relationships in the Time Hero game system.

**IMPORTANT**: This is a data visualization tool, not a gameplay interface. It shows upgrade relationships without status indicators, affordability calculations, or other gameplay mechanics.

## üéØ Key Features

### Visual Design
- **Civilization V Layout**: Horizontal progression from left (early upgrades) to right (late upgrades)
- **Source-Based Swim Lanes**: Each upgrade source (Farm, Blacksmith, Adventure, etc.) gets its own horizontal lane
- **Tier-Based Positioning**: Upgrades are positioned by their dependency tier (0 = no prerequisites, 1 = depends on tier 0, etc.)
- **Data-Only Tooltips**: Hover over any upgrade to see upgrade information, costs, and effects (no gameplay status)
- **Scrollable Container**: The tree can be much wider than the screen - use scroll controls to navigate
- **Non-Functional Zoom Controls**: Zoom buttons are present but currently not working due to reactivity issues

### Pure Data Visualization
- **No Gameplay Elements**: Removed all ownership status, affordability calculations, and gameplay logic
- **Source Colors**: Nodes use their source colors directly without status-based color coding
- **Clean Display**: Focus purely on showing upgrade relationships and data structure
- **No Status Indicators**: Removed colored circles and status overlays that were used in gameplay versions

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **UpgradeTree.vue** (Page Container)
- **Purpose**: Main page wrapper that provides the scrollable container
- **Key Features**:
  - Responsive height (`h-[80vh] min-h-[600px]`)
  - Horizontal and vertical scrolling (`overflow-auto`)
  - Houses the main visualization component

#### 2. **UpgradeTreeVisualizationNew.vue** (Main Visualization)
- **Purpose**: SVG-based tree rendering with interactive nodes and connections
- **Key Features**:
  - SVG canvas with calculated dimensions based on tree layout
  - Interactive node circles with hover states
  - Dependency arrows connecting related upgrades
  - Real-time updates based on game state changes

#### 3. **Data-Only Tooltips** (Information Display)
- **Purpose**: Clean upgrade information shown on hover without gameplay elements
- **Key Features**:
  - **Basic Information**: Upgrade name, description, source
  - **Cost Breakdown**: Gold, energy, materials, boss materials
  - **Effects Description**: What the upgrade does
  - **Prerequisites**: What upgrades are required before this one
  - **No Gameplay Status**: Removed affordability checks, ownership status, and time-to-afford calculations
  - **Null-Safe**: Handles missing data gracefully to prevent crashes

### Data Flow Architecture

```
CSV Data Files (data/*.csv)
         ‚Üì
   Game Values Store (gameValues.js)
         ‚Üì
   Upgrade Tree Composable (useUpgradeTree.js)
         ‚Üì
   Tree Layout Engine (treeLayoutEngine.js) [CLEANED: No gameplay logic]
         ‚Üì
   Visualization Component (UpgradeTreeVisualizationNew.vue) [CLEANED: No status indicators]
         ‚Üì
   Data-Only Tooltips [CLEANED: No gameplay status]
```

**Note**: All gameplay-related logic (status calculations, affordability checks, ownership tracking) has been removed to create a pure data visualization tool.

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline

#### CSV Data Loading
- Upgrade data is loaded from multiple CSV files in `/data/` directory
- Files include: `town_blacksmith.csv`, `town_agronomist.csv`, `weapons.csv`, `armor_base.csv`, etc.
- Each CSV row becomes a node in the upgrade tree

#### Node Classification
- **Source Classification**: Each upgrade is categorized by its source file (Farm, Blacksmith, Adventure, etc.)
- **Prerequisite Parsing**: Dependencies are parsed from CSV columns (supports semicolon separation)
- **Tier Calculation**: Nodes are assigned tiers based on their dependency depth

#### Layout Engine
- **Global Tier System**: All nodes get tiers calculated globally (not per-source)
- **Swim Lane Layout**: Sources become horizontal lanes with consistent spacing
- **Positioning Algorithm**: Nodes positioned by `(tier √ó TIER_WIDTH, lane √ó LANE_HEIGHT)`

### 2. Interactive Features

#### Hover System
- **Tooltip Display**: Clean upgrade information appears when hovering over nodes
- **Data Focus**: Shows upgrade costs, effects, and prerequisites without gameplay status
- **State Management**: Hover state is tracked and managed reactively

#### Pure Visualization
- **No Status Updates**: Tree displays static upgrade relationships without real-time game state
- **Source Colors**: Node colors reflect their data source (Farm=green, Blacksmith=orange, etc.)
- **Data Relationships**: Focus on showing prerequisite chains and upgrade dependencies

### 3. Performance Optimizations

#### Defensive Programming
- **Null Checks**: All data access includes null/undefined checks
- **Error Boundaries**: Components handle missing data gracefully
- **Safe Rendering**: Template guards prevent crashes from incomplete data

#### Efficient Updates
- **Computed Properties**: Layout calculations are cached and only re-run when needed
- **Reactive State**: Vue's reactivity system ensures minimal re-renders
- **SVG Optimization**: Vector graphics provide smooth scaling and interaction

## üêõ Known Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **Zoom Controls Not Working**
   - **Problem**: Zoom in/out/reset/fit buttons are not functional
   - **Root Cause**: Vue reactivity issue between `useUpgradeInteractions` composable and template
   - **Symptoms**: `viewTransform` values update in composable but show as `undefined` in template
   - **Current State**: Transform values (zoom: 1.1, panX: -49.95) update correctly in logs but don't apply to SVG DOM
   - **Attempted Fixes**: Direct template binding, computed properties, explicit reactivity tracking
   - **Next Steps**: Need to resolve `interactions.viewTransform.zoom/panX/panY` returning undefined in template

### Technical Details
- Functions in `useUpgradeInteractions.js` execute correctly
- `viewTransform.value` updates properly in composable  
- Template watchers detect changes but receive `undefined` values
- SVG transform style remains empty string / "none"
- Issue appears to be Vue 3 reactivity between composable ref exports and template access

## üéÆ User Interaction Guide

### Navigation
1. **Scrolling**: Use mouse wheel or scroll bars to navigate the large tree
2. **Hover Information**: Move mouse over any upgrade to see data tooltip
3. **Node Colors**: Each color represents a different upgrade source (Farm, Blacksmith, Adventure, etc.)
4. **Zoom Controls**: Present but currently non-functional due to reactivity issues

### Understanding the Layout
1. **Left to Right**: Early game upgrades are on the left, late game on the right
2. **Horizontal Lanes**: Each lane represents a different upgrade source (Farm, Blacksmith, etc.)
3. **Arrows**: Lines connect prerequisites to their dependent upgrades
4. **Tiers**: Vertical columns represent dependency tiers (tier 0 = no requirements)

### Tooltip Information
- **Basic Info**: Shows upgrade name, source, and description
- **Cost Section**: Shows what resources are needed to purchase the upgrade
- **Effects Section**: Describes what the upgrade does
- **Prerequisites**: Lists other upgrades required first
- **Note**: No gameplay status (affordability, ownership, time-to-afford) is shown

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Current Known Issues

#### Zoom Controls Not Working
- **Symptoms**: Buttons click but no visual change occurs
- **Diagnosis**: Vue reactivity disconnect between composable and template
- **Debug Evidence**: 
  - Composable: `{ zoom: 1.1, panX: -49.95, panY: -30 }` ‚úÖ
  - Template: `{ zoom: undefined, panX: undefined, panY: undefined }` ‚ùå
- **Technical Details**: `interactions.viewTransform` properties return undefined despite successful updates in composable

#### Legacy Issues (Resolved)
- **Tooltip Crashes**: Fixed by removing gameplay logic and adding null checks
